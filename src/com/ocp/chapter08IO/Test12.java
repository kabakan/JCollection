/**
 * Created by Kanat KB on 19.10.2017.12. Suppose that the file c:\book\java exists. Which of the following lines of code creates an
 * object that represents the file? (Choose all that apply.)
 * <p>
 * 12. B, C. Option B is correct because Java requires a backslash to be escaped with another
 * backslash. Option C is also correct because Java will convert the slashes to the right one
 * when working with paths.
 * <p>
 * A. new File("c:\book\java");
 * B. new File("c:\\book\\java");   ***
 * C. new File("c:/book/java");    ***
 * D. new File("c://book//java");
