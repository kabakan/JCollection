 * <p>
 * 8. Which of the following are true of interfaces? (Choose all that apply.)
 * <p>
 * 8. C, F. A and B are both incorrect as interfaces can extend other interfaces, although not
 * classes. C is correct since a class may implement multiple interfaces. D is incorrect as interfaces
 * have static and default methods, as well as static final variables. E is incorrect
 * as interfaces are assumed to be abstract, and abstract and final can never be used
 * together. F is correct as interface methods and variables are each assumed public.
 * <p>
 * A. They can extend other classes.
 * B. They cannot be extended.
 * C. They enable classes to have multiple inheritance.
 * D. They can only contain abstract methods.
 * E. They can be declared final.
 * F. All members of an interface are public.
