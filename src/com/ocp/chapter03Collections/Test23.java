 * <p>
 * 23. B, E. Both Comparator and Comparable are functional interfaces. However, Comparable is
 * intended to be used on the object being compared, making choice B correct. removeIf was
 * added in Java 8 to allow specifying the lambda to check when removing elements, making
 * choice E correct.
