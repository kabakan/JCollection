/**
 * Created by Kanat KB on 11.09.2017.
 * <p>
 * 20. What is the result of the following code?
 * <p>
 * 20. E. This question looks like it is about generics, but itâ€™s not. It is trying to see if
 * you noticed that Map does not have a contains() method. It has containsKey() and
 * containsValue() instead. If containsKey() was called, the answer would be false
 * because the 123 in the list is an Integer rather than a String.
 * <p>
 * A. false
 * B. true
 * C. Compiler error on line 4.
 * D. Compiler error on line 5.
 * E. Compiler error on line 7.  ***
 * F. A runtime exception is thrown.
