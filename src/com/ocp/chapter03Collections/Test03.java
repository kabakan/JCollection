 * 3. What is the result of the following statements?
 * <p>
 * 3. E. The code does not compile. It attempts to mix generics and legacy code. Lines 3 through
 * 7 create an ArrayList without generics. This means that we can put any objects in it.
 * Line 7 should be looping through a list of Objects rather than Strings since we didnâ€™t use
 * generics.
 * <p>
 * A. onetwo
 * B. onetwo7
 * C. onetwo followed by an exception
 * D. Compiler error on line 6
 * E. Compiler error on line 7  ***
