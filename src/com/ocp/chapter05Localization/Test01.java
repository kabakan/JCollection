 * 1. Which of the following creates valid locales, assuming that the language and country codes
 * follow standard conventions?
 * <p>
 * 1. A, B. Choices E and F are incorrect because a Locale is created using a constructor. The
 * convention is to use lowercase for a language code and uppercase for a country code. The
 * language is mandatory when using a constructor, which makes choices A and B correct.
 * <p>
 * A. new Locale("hi");
 * B. new Locale("hi", "IN");  ***
 * C. new Locale("IN");
 * D. new Locale("IN", "hi");
 * E. Locale.create("hi");
 * F. Locale.create("IN");
