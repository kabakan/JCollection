/**
 * Created by Kanat KB on 24.10.2017.
 * 19. What are three advantages of the NIO.2 API over the legacy java.io.File class for working with files?
 * <p>
 * 19. A, C, E. While all of the answers are applicable to the NIO.2, only A, C, and E are options
 * that are not supported by the legacy java.io.File class and therefore give NIO.2 an
 * advantage over java.io.File.
 * <p>
 * A. NIO.2 supports file systemâ€“dependent attributes.    ***
 * B. NIO.2 can be used to list all the files within a single directory.
 * C. NIO.2 allows you to traverse a directory tree directly.   ***
 * D. NIO.2 can be used to delete files and non-empty directories.
 * E. NIO.2 supports symbolic links.   ***
 * F. NIO.2 can be used to read the last-modified time.
