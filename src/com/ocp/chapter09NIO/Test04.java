/**
 * Created by Kanat KB on 24.10.2017.
 * 4. If the current working directory is /user/home, then what is the output of the following
 * code?
 * 4. C. First off, the code compiles without issue, so G is incorrect. Letâ€™s take this one step at a
 * time. First, the subpath() method is applied to the absolute path, which returns the relative
 * path animals/bear. Next, the getName() method is applied to the relative path, and since
 * this is indexed from zero, it returns the relative path bear. Finally, the toAbsolutePath()
 * method is applied to the relative path bear, resulting in the current directory being incorporated
 * into the path. The final output is the absolute path /user/home/bear, so C is correct.
 * <p>
 * A. animals/bear
 * B. koala
 * C. /user/home/bear ***
 * D. /user/home/koala/koala
 * E. /user/home/food.txt
 * F. /user/home/koala/food.txt
 * G. The code does not compile.
