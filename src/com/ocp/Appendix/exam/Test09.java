 * 9. A,F. Option A is correct. Identifiers are allowed to begin with underscores. Numeric values
 are allowed to have underscores between two digits. Option B is incorrect because underscores
 are not allowed adjacent to a decimal point. Option C is incorrect because identifiers
 are not allowed to start with digits. Option D is incorrect because decimal values are not
 allowed in int variablesâ€”they can only go in float or double types. Option E is incorrect
 because 10d declares a double, and a double is bigger than a float. Option F is correct
 because it is a straightforward variable assignment.
