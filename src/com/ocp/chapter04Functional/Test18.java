 * 18. What is the result of the following?
 * <p>
 * 18. D. The terminal operation is count(). Since there is a terminal operation, the intermediate
 * operations run. The peek() operation comes before the filter, so both numbers are printed.
 * The count happens to be 1 since the other number is filtered. However, the result of the
 * stream pipeline isnâ€™t stored in a variable, and that result is ignored.
 * <p>
 * A. 1
 * B. 2
 * C. 2.4
 * D. 1.2 and 2.4   ***
 * E. There is no output.
 * F. The code does not compile.
 * G. An exception is thrown.
