 * 5. Which terminal operations on the Stream class are reductions? (Choose all that apply.)
 * <p>
 * 5. A, B. Options D and E are incorrect because they are intermediate operations and not terminal
 * operations. While option F is a reduction, it is incorrect because it is available only
 * on primitive streams such as IntStream. Option C is incorrect because it is not a reductionâ€”
 * it does not look at each element in the stream.
 * <p>
 * A. collect()  ***
 * B. count()   ***
 * C. findFirst()
 * D. map()
 * E. peek()
