 * <p>
 * 17. Which of the following are properties of classes that are properly encapsulated as a
 * JavaBean? (Choose all that apply.)
 * <p>
 * 17. B, C, F. Options B, C, and F are each correct statements about JavaBean encapsulation.
 * A is incorrect, as that is a property of the immutable object pattern, not encapsulation. D
 * is incorrect, as there is no such JavaBean interface defined in the Java API. Finally, E is
 * incorrect, as handling instantiation is not part of encapsulation.
 * <p>
 * A. All instance variables are marked final.
 * B. boolean instance variables are accessed with is or get.  ***
 * C. All instance variables are marked private.  ***
 * D. They implement the JavaBean interface.
 * E. Variables are created using lazy instantiation.
 * F. The first letter of the any getter/setter, after the get, set, or is prefix, must be uppercase. ***
