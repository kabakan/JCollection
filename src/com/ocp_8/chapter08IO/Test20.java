/**
 * Created by Kanat KB on 19.10.2017.
 * 20. What are some reasons to use a character stream, such as Reader/Writer, over a byte
 * stream, such as InputStream/OutputStream? (Choose all that apply.)
 * <p>
 * 20. A, C. Character stream classes often include built-in convenience methods for working with
 * String data, so A is correct. They also handle character encoding automatically, so C is
 * also correct. The rest of the statements are irrelevant or incorrect and are not properties of
 * all character streams.
 * <p>
 * A. More convenient code syntax when working with String data     ***
 * B. Improved performance
 * C. Automatic character encoding                                  ***
 * D. Built-in serialization and deserialization
 * E. Character streams are high-level streams
 * F. Multi-threading support
