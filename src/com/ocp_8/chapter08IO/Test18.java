/**
 * Created by Kanat KB on 19.10.2017.
 * 18. Which values when inserted into the blank would allow the code to compile? (Choose all that apply.)
 * <p>
 * 18. B, D, E. Console defines two output methods, format() and printf(), that are identical
 * in function, so B and D are correct. A, C, and F are each incorrect, because there is no
 * such method with that name defined in the Console class. You can also use the writer()
 * method to gain access to the Consoleâ€™s PrintWriter object, so E is correct.
 * <p>
 * A. print
 * B. printf              ***
 * C. println
 * D. format              ***
 * E. writer().println    ***
 * F. out
